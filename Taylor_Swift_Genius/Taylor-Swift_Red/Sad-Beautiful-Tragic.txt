TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsFrançaisSad Beautiful Tragic Lyrics
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affairSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $270You might also like20Embed
