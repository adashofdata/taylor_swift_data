0,Taylor Swift,Mary's Song (Oh My My My),"She said I was seven and you were nine I looked at you like the stars that shined In the sky, the pretty lights And our daddies used to joke about the two of us Growing up and falling in love And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""  Take me back to the house in the backyard tree Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me You never did, you never did Take me back when our world was one block wide I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried Just two kids, you and I Oh, my, my, my, my Well, I was sixteen when suddenly I wasn't that little girl you used to see But your eyes still shined like pretty lights And our daddies used to joke about the two of us They never believed we'd really fall in love And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""  Take me back to the creek beds we turned up 2 a.m. riding in your truck And all I need is you next to me Take me back to the time we had our very first fight The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight You stayed outside 'til the morning light Oh, my, my, my, my  A few years had gone and come around We were sitting at our favorite spot in town And you looked at me, got down on one knee  Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle Our whole town came and our mamas cried You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too Take me home where we met so many years before We'll rock our babies on that very front porch After all this time, you and I You might also like And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine I'll still look at you like the stars that shine In the sky, oh, my, my, my"
1,Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,"Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart? Why would you wanna take Our love and tear it all apart now? Why would you wanna make The very first scar? Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart?  Maybe I should've seen the signs Should've read the writing on the wall And realized by the distance in your eyes That I would be the one to fall No matter what you say I still can't believe that you would walk away It don't make sense to me, but  Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart? Why would you wanna take Our love and tear it all apart now? Why would you wanna make The very first scar? Why would you wanna break A perfectly good heart?

2,Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,"He said the way my blue eyes shined Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, ""That's a lie"" Just a boy in a Chevy truck That had a tendency of gettin' stuck On backroads at night And I was right there beside him all summer long And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone  But when you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me September saw a month of tears And thankin' God that you weren't here To see me like that But in a box beneath my bed Is a letter that you never read From three summers back It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe  When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me  And I'm back for the first time since then I'm standin' on your street And there's a letter left on your doorstep And the first thing that you'll read is: ""When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song Someday you'll turn your radio on I hope it takes you back to that place"" You might also like When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me Oh, think of me Mmmm  He said the way my blue eyes shine Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, ""That's a lie"""
