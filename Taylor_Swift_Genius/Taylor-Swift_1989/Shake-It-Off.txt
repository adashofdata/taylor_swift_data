I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates (Haha)
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"

And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been gettin' down
To this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, "Oh my God!" But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
