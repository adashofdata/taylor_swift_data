A Perfectly Good Heart Lyrics
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still can't believe that you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore (It's not unbroken anymore)
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna breakâ€”
(Why) Would you wanna break it?

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now?
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar?
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart?
